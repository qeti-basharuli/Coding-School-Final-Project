            <h2>Georgia's Captivating Capital City</h2>
            <p>
              Georgia’s capital city, Tbilisi, is a hybrid of different
              influences. The religion, the culture, the food, the vernacular
              architecture and the very way of life here is all fundamentally
              Georgian. If you have no idea what that means, you’ll have a
              wonderful time finding out.

            <h2>The Old Capital</h2>
            <p>
              Mtskheta was the ancient capital of Kartli, the East Georgian
              Kingdom from the 3rd century BC to the 5th century AD, and was
              also the location where Christianity was proclaimed as the
              official religion of Georgia in 337. To date, it still remains the
              headquarters of the Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church. One of
              the nation’s four UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Historical
              Monuments of Mtskheta, is located here and comprises a set of
              monasteries noted for their frescoes and inscriptions in an early
              version of the Georgian alphabet.

            <span class="slide-text">Jvari Monastery</span>
            <p>
              Jvari Monastery, built in the 6th century on a hill above
              Mtskheta, is a must-visit in Georgia. The church itself is quite
              modest inside, but the view from the churchyard – a stunning
              panorama of the confluence of the Mtkvari and Aragvi rivers, one
              blue and the other emerald – is simply breathtaking.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The Mtskheta church of Jvari is the first sample of the
              cross-shaped type churches, it is a new thing in the architecture.
              Other structures around the monastery (tower, fence) are much
              older. On the facades of the temple, you can see religious and
              historical persons, there are old inscriptions too.

            <h2>The Cultural Heart Of Georgia</h2>
            <p>
              Kutaisi served as the political centre of the Kingdom of Colchis
              in the Middle Ages. Later it became Georgia’s cultural capital –
              the stomping ground of countless poets, musicians and scholars –
              until Soviet times, when Kutaisi was retrofitted for industry and
              her skyline remoulded.

            <p>
              The main city in Samtskhe-Javakheti region, Akhaltsikhe is small
              but very multicultural and with a long history that spans Ottoman,
              Mongol and Iranian rule. The name Akhaltsikhe means ‘New
              Fortress’, which gives you a clue to the city’s heritage and
              fighting spirit.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The main attraction is Akhaltsikhe Castle (Rabati Castle), a
              massive hilltop fortress. Established in the 9th century as Lomisa
              Castle, it received a mosque and madrasa during the Ottoman period
              and was gradually added to over the intervening years to become an
              ad-hoc complex of watch towers, fountains, domed buildings and
              gardens.

              The walled city of Signaghi is the beating heart of Kakheti,
              Georgia’s most productive wine region. This is far from the only
              place where grapes grow, but it’s definitely the most popular
              place to do a wine tasting in Georgia, especially since it’s so
              close to Tbilisi.Signaghi is encased in stone city walls and
              ramparts that you can climb for stunning views over the valley,
              hemmed in by the Caucasus mountains beyond.

            Georgia is located at the intersection of Europe and Asia, on the

            completely different forms and constructions. The Georgian alphabet
            has passed through three stages throughout its long history:
            Asomtavruli (Khutsuri Asomtavruli, or Mrglovani), Nuskhuri
            (Khutsuri, Nuskha-Khutsuri, Kutkhovani), and Mkhedruli. Each of them
            is distinguished by its characteristic graphic style. Changes in the

            The Gudauri mountain resort is located 120 kilometers from Tbilisi.
            The powder lovers from the capital drive there almost every winter
            weekend to get their adrenaline fixed. Besides the pistes for
            skilled winter sports fans, there are also children- and
            beginner-friendly slopes as well, so if you ever wanted to learn
            skiing or snowboarding, this is your chance! The snow covers
            Gudauri’s slopes for at least four months, so if you love to ski or
            are into extreme winter sports, this is the place for you.
