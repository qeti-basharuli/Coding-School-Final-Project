            Georgia is located at the intersection of Europe and Asia, on the
            shores of the Black Sea, in the Caucasus Mountains. For centuries,
            it has served to connect civilizations, with the Silk Road, the
            world’s largest commercial artery, passing through it. Georgia is a
            small and beautiful country with diverse nature and a generally mild
            climate, set in an advantageous geographical location. To the north
            are the Greater Caucasus Range and its glaciers, and to the south is
            the Lesser Caucasus Range.

            completely different forms and constructions. The Georgian alphabet
            has passed through three stages throughout its long history:
            Asomtavruli (Khutsuri Asomtavruli, or Mrglovani), Nuskhuri
            (Khutsuri, Nuskha-Khutsuri, Kutkhovani), and Mkhedruli. Each of them
            is distinguished by its characteristic graphic style. Changes in the

            The nature of Georgia offers an incredible variety of landscapes,

            Lesser Caucasus in the south. Mountains occupy two thirds of
            Georgia’s land area. In the west of the country lies the Colchis

            Georgian nature features a river system which comprises nearly 25
            thousand rivers and tributaries. They are fed mainly by thawed snow
            and glacial waters, underground aquifers and atmospheric
            precipitation. The longest river, Kura (in Georgian language
            Mktvari) is 1364 km originating in eastern Turkey, terminating at a
            confluence of reservoirs and emptying into the Caspian Sea in
            Azerbaijan.
